Repo for SoC Assignments

## Assignment 1 (Deadline - 11 April 2021)

To replicate the internet.iitb.ac.in page using only HTML and internal CSS.

### Obstacles I faced :-

This assignment was quite easy. I just had to figure out the iitb page was essentially made up of tables, and it was all a piece of cake from thereon.ðŸ˜„

## Assignment 2 (Deadline - 19 May 2021)

To add dark mode to the page in assignment 1 and to also restrict successful login for a specified set of roll numbers.

### Obstacles I faced :-

Adding dark mode was OK, but handling the login using JS took a lot of time, since most of the things I tried wouldn't work. I guess I have a lot more to learn.ðŸ˜‰

## Assignment 3 (Deadline - 10 June 2021)

To make any creative website I can come up with using Angular.

I love doing photoshop art as a hobby. So I thought why not make a website showcasing that. So I made just that. It's not perfect but I'm happy with the way it turned out.ðŸ˜‡

### Obstacles I faced :-

So this one was a little tough. The CSS sometimes just does not work. It's quite a hassle. I also had problems integrating JS with Angular framework. After disturbing my mentor with a lot of doubts and googling I finally got it right. Phew!

### Progress

Studied HTML, CSS, JS and Angular but a lot more practise is required for perfection. I also learnt a lot of shortcuts and features in vscode. One other thing I learned was the most useful git and github. Currently studying PHP. Will move on to Typescript, React and Jquery in the future! I'm excited :)
